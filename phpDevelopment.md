In this topic, we will learn about how to make a complete blog website using PHP. Okay, let's start our project. In PHP Development you need software called **XAMPP**. XAMPP will help you to start **Apache** & **MYSQL** servers. So, first, install it and start them.

After Installation you will get a folder in **C:** drive named "xampp". Inside "xampp", you will find another folder named "htdocs". Create your project folder there.

> **My suggestion is**, First make your project frontend using web language then paste your folder inside htdocs. 

A blog website can be divided into two parts. **User** part and **Admin** part.  **The user Part** is a part where the user can read posts and do some activities. But **Admin Part** is a part where an admin can create posts, manage posts, etc.

## Admin Route

Generally, admin routes are like `https://domain-name/admin`
